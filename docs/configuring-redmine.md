# Setting up Redmine

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [Redmine](https://github.com/dani-garcia/redmine) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

Redmine is an unofficial [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) compatible server.

See the project's [documentation](https://github.com/dani-garcia/redmine/blob/main/README.md) to learn what Redmine does and why it might be useful to you.

## Prerequisites

To run a Redmine instance it is necessary to prepare a database. You can use a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) compatible database server, [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), or SQL Server.

If you are looking for Ansible roles for a MySQL compatible server or Postgres, you can check out [ansible-role-mariadb](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-mariadb) and [ansible-role-postgres](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-postgres), both of which are maintained by the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting (MASH)](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting) team.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable Redmine with this role, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

**Note**: the path should be something like `inventory/host_vars/mash.example.com/vars.yml` if you use the [MASH Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# redmine                                                              #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

redmine_enabled: true

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /redmine                                                             #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

### Set the hostname

To enable Redmine you need to set the hostname as well. To do so, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace `example.com` with your own value.

```yaml
redmine_hostname: "example.com"
```

After adjusting the hostname, make sure to adjust your DNS records to point the domain to your server.

### Set random strings for secrets

You also need to set random strings for secret keys and a session encryption token. To do so, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. The values can be generated with `pwgen -s 64 1` or in another way.

```yaml
# Specify secret key base
redmine_secret_key_base: ""

# Specify session encryption token
redmine_secret_token: ""

# Specify base data secret key
redmine_database_cipher_key: ""
```

### Configuring database

#### Specify database

It is necessary to select database used by Redmine from a MySQL compatible database, Postgres, SQLite, and SQL server.

To use Postgres, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
redmine_database_type: postgres
```

Set `mysql` to use a MySQL compatible database and `sqlite` to use SQLite, respectively. The SQLite database is stored in the directory specified with `redmine_data_path`.

For other settings, check variables such as `redmine_database_*` on [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml).

#### Configuring connection to the database server (optional)

By default the role is configured to establish the connection to the database server via a Unix socket. You can mount the Unix socket by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
# Specify the path to the MySQL compatible server's Unix socket path on the host (bind-mount source)
redmine_database_mysql_socket_path_host: ""

# Specify the path to the Postgres Unix socket path on the host (bind-mount source)
redmine_database_postgres_socket_path_host: ""
```

Setting it enables to connect to the database server via Unix socket mounted in the container.

If TCP connection is preferred, connection via the Unix socket can be disabled by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
# Disable the connection to the MySQL compatible server via a Unix socket
redmine_database_mysql_socket_enabled: false

# Disable the connection to the Postgres server via a Unix socket
redmine_database_postgres_socket_enabled: false
```

### Configuring the mailer (optional)

To configure a SMTP mailer, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file as below (adapt to your needs):

```yaml
# Specify SMTP server hostname
redmine_email_delivery_smtp_settings_address: ""

# Specify SMTP server port number
redmine_email_delivery_smtp_settings_port: 587

# Specify SMTP server username
redmine_email_delivery_smtp_user_name: ""

# Specify SMTP server password
redmine_email_delivery_smtp_password: ""

# Specify the SMTP Auth Type
redmine_email_delivery_smtp_settings_authentication: ""
```

>[!WARNING]
> Without setting an authentication method such as DKIM, SPF, and DMARC for your hostname, emails are most likely to be quarantined as spam at recipient's mail servers. The worst scenario is that your server's IP address or hostname will be included in the spam list such as the one managed by [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/). If you have set up a mail server with the [MASH project's exim-relay Ansible role](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-exim-relay), you can enable DKIM signing with it. Refer [its documentation](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-exim-relay/blob/main/docs/configuring-exim-relay.md#enable-dkim-support-optional) for details.

### Extending the configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the service.

Take a look at:

- [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml) for some variables that you can customize via your `vars.yml` file. You can override settings (even those that don't have dedicated playbook variables) using the `redmine_environment_variables_additional_variables` variable

Refer to [the official documentation](https://github.com/dani-garcia/redmine/blob/main/.env.template) for a complete list of Redmine's config options that you can put in `redmine_environment_variables_additional_variables`.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the installation command of your playbook as below:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

If you use the MASH playbook, the shortcut commands with the [`just` program](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

## Usage

After running the command for installation, Redmine becomes available at the specified hostname like `https://example.com`.

To get started, open the URL `https://example.com/PATH_PREFIX/admin` with a web browser to create an account.

### Take over the `admin` account immediately

Redmine flags the account as having to change its password at first login, so whoever logs in first is the one who gets to set the real password. It is recommended to **log in and change the password before pointing anyone at the instance.**

### Enable the REST API if you need it

Redmine's REST API is disabled by default and is turned on under *Administration → Settings → API*.

## Troubleshooting

### Check the service's logs

You can find the logs in [systemd-journald](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html) by logging in to the server with SSH and running `journalctl -fu redmine` (or how you/your playbook named the service, e.g. `mash-redmine`).
